[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/darrenmcgill35/milestone_project_4.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/darrenmcgill35/milestone_project_4)

The website can be found at: https://sportsblogproject4.herokuapp.com/
The code can be found at: https://github.com/darrenmcgill35/milestone_project_4

## *What does it do and what need does it fulfil?*

For my Third Milestone project I chose to design and code a Review site that is all 
about using the CRUD operations. (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

It also provides a Blog page to keep up to date with news and a merchandise page to view available sports wear. 

Finally I also used the Google maps API to have a map showing the location of the Sports Store. 


## *Functionality of project.*

The website is fully responsive. It is a 5 pages website with navigation buttons on the home page to 
direct you to the Blog, Add & Review, Edit & Delete and Merchandise pages  

The Blog page has a number of small articles with the option to read the full article via a Read More button.

Thy Add & Review page displays a simple form which the user can fill in and simply chick the ADD REVIEW button. 
This will redirect the user to the EDIT & DELETE Page. 

The Edit & Delete page allows the user to review all submissions. It also allows the user to Edit or Delete the 
Submissions.

The Merchandise page displays a number of projects with prices and a map with the store location. 

All social icons are functional and direct the user to Two different pages. 


## *UX*

This website is designed and created for a wide varity of people.
Responsive design was important as members of the public could add and review players 
when out and about at matches or at home on a tablet or desktop.  

Click on the directory [user-design-experience](https://github.com/darrenmcgill35/milestone-project-3/tree/master/static/user-design-experience) for all the Planes, 
including User Stories, wireframes, mock-ups, diagrams that I created as part 
of the design process.


## *Technologies Used*

* HTML5 - markup language
* CSS3 - used to style the page
* Bootstrap 4 - for grid layout, navigation, responsive design and columns
* Bootstrap Themes
* Javascript - for adding the map to my site. 
* Python
* The Flask Framework
* Jinja templates
* GIT
* GITHUB
* Heroku - to host the website
* MongoDB Atlas - for storing input data from my form. 
* Google Chrome developer tools
* Pycharm IDE from JetBrains
* Fontawesome
* Cloudflare
* Jquery
* Google Maps API - Google Developers
* Wireframe.cc
* Paint.net


## *Testing*

The site was tested locally and in Heroku using Chrome developer tools, 
testing its functionality as well as look and feel
(in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, S6, S8, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, 
iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop. 
All links were tested. 

I validated my HTML with WC3 Validator, 

Warning and error showed Duplicate ID which was easily fixed. 

I validated my CSS with The W3C CSS Validation Service,

Congratulations! No Error Found.

I checked my app.py code using Python syntax checker

Result - No syntax errors detected :)

Using a checklist I sourced from a testing [website](https://geteasyqa.com/qa/test-website/) I checked 
1. Documentation
1. Website functionality
    * Links testing
    * Forms testing for all pages
    * HTML/CSS validation
1. Usability
    * Navigation testing
    * Content testing
1. UI (User Interface) 
    * Testing with different screen resolutions
    * Testing the graphical user interface on target devices: smartphones and tablets.
1. Compatibility (Configuration)
    * Cross-platform testing
    * Cross-browser website testing
    * Database testing
    
I sent the heroku link to many people to test on different mobiles tablets and desktops. 
All pages, images and forms were responsive with no issues. 

 
## *Deployment*

1. The Website was coded using the Pycharm IDE. 
1. A local GIT directory was used for version control. 
1. It was then uploaded to GITHUB using Ubuntu / Bash script. 
    * git add . (Adds files to be committed)
    * git commit -m "Initial commit" (for first commit and every other commit 
      thereafter a comment about what was changed ie. 
      "Updated footer in index.html")
    * git push (This command is used to upload local repository content
      to a remote repository.)
    
1. Once in a GITHUB repositories the code was live using GITHUB Pages. 

1. As this is a python app the website was made live using Heroku.
1. Similar to GITHUB using git add and commit I pushed to Heroku using 
'git push heroku master'. 

1. Later on in the project I was introduced to CICD - continuous integration and continuous delivery. Using
my new Pycharm IDE I could just Click the green tick (Commit), write my commit message and click commit and push.
After linking my Github repository to my Heroku app this one time push will update my code on Github and 
deploy the app on Heroku.
