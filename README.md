## *What does it do and what need does it fulfil?*

For my Fourth Milestone project I chose to design and code a Blog site with an Ecommerce App that is all 
about creating and updating blog posts as well as viewing a store to purchase items.

Finally I also used the Google maps API to have a map showing the location of a new museum at GAA Headquarters . 


## *Functionality of project.*

The website is fully responsive. It is a multi-pages website with navigation buttons on the home page to 
direct you to the Blog, Store, Cart, Profile, Login/Logout pages  

Each Blog post can be viewed by everyone but only can be edited by the creator.

By clicking on the post you will be redirected and be able to update ot delete thr post. 

Without registration you will still be able to view all posts but once you register you will be opened up the the 
Store, and be able to create posts.

The Store page displays a number of Items with prices and you can add to your cart. 

The Cart page gives you your total and a checkout button.

The Checkout page has a payment details form so you can purchase the items.

All Announcements will be visible on all pages and the link will redirect you to the news article . 


## *UX*

This website is designed and created for a wide variety of people.
Responsive design was important as members of the public could add posts 
when out and about at matches or at home on a tablet or desktop.  

Click on the directory [user-design-experience](https://github.com/darrenmcgill35/milestone_project_4/tree/master/media/user-design-experience) for all the Planes, 
including User Stories, wireframes, mock-ups, diagrams that I created as part 
of the design process.


## *Technologies Used*

* HTML5 - markup language
* CSS3 - used to style the page
* Bootstrap 4 - for grid layout, navigation, responsive design and columns
* Javascript - for adding the map to my site and stripe payments. 
* Python 3.7
* Django
* The Flask Framework
* Jinja templates
* GIT
* GITHUB
* Heroku - to host the website
* db.sqlite3
* Postgres
* Google Chrome developer tools
* Pycharm IDE from JetBrains
* Fontawesome
* Cloudflare
* Jquery
* Google Maps API - Google Developers
* Wireframe.cc
* Paint.net
* Travis CI
* AWS S3 Buckets
* Youtube tutorials on the new version of Python, Django storages, deploying to heroku & Travis CI.


## *Testing*

The site was tested locally and in Heroku using Chrome developer tools, 
testing its functionality as well as look and feel
(in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, S6, S8, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, 
iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop. 
All links were tested. 

I validated my HTML with WC3 Validator, 

Warning and error showed Duplicate ID which was easily fixed. 

I validated my CSS with The W3C CSS Validation Service,

Congratulations! No Error Found.

I checked all app code using Python syntax checker

Result - No syntax errors detected :)

Using a checklist I sourced from a testing [website](https://geteasyqa.com/qa/test-website/) I checked 
1. Documentation
1. Website functionality
    * Links testing
    * Forms testing for all pages
    * HTML/CSS validation
1. Usability
    * Navigation testing
    * Content testing
1. UI (User Interface) 
    * Testing with different screen resolutions
    * Testing the graphical user interface on target devices: smartphones and tablets.
1. Compatibility (Configuration)
    * Cross-platform testing
    * Cross-browser website testing
    * Database testing
    
I sent the heroku link to many people to test on different mobiles tablets and desktops. 
All pages, images and forms were responsive with no issues. 

 
## *Deployment*

1. The Website was coded using the Pycharm IDE. 
1. A local GIT directory was used for version control. 
1. It was then uploaded to GITHUB using Ubuntu / Bash script. 
    * git add . (Adds files to be committed)
    * git commit -m "Initial commit" (for first commit and every other commit 
      thereafter a comment about what was changed ie. 
      "Updated footer in index.html")
    * git push (This command is used to upload local repository content
      to a remote repository.)
    
1. Once in a GITHUB repositories the code was live using GITHUB Pages. 

1. As this is a python app the website was made live using Heroku.
1. Similar to GITHUB using git add and commit I pushed to Heroku using 
'git push heroku master'. 

1. All media files are stored in the cloud using AWS S3. Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a 
service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. 
Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its global e-commerce network.
